# learn-python-resources
A bunch of FREE resources, articles, and videos I found extremely useful for learning different Python concepts. Feel free to submit a PR with any resources you love. 
And of course, when in doubt, [read the docs!](https://docs.python.org/3.5/)

#### Programming Interviews
[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)

#### Language Concepts
[Classmethods, Staticmethods, and AbstractMethods](https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/guide-python-static-class-abstract-methods)
